# RAG Domain Model Documentation

## 🏛️ Domain-Driven Design Overview

This document describes the domain model of our RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application, following Domain-Driven Design principles.

## 📋 Ubiquitous Language

### Core Business Concepts

- **Query**: A user's information request that needs to be answered
- **Document**: A source of knowledge that can answer queries
- **Chunk**: A semantically meaningful piece of a document
- **Retrieval**: The process of finding relevant information for a query
- **Generation**: The process of creating a natural language response
- **Context**: The assembled information used to generate responses
- **Relevance**: How well a document chunk matches a query's intent
- **Confidence**: How certain the system is about its response

### Business Operations

- **Query Processing**: Analyzing and enriching user queries
- **Document Ingestion**: Adding new knowledge to the system
- **Knowledge Retrieval**: Finding relevant information
- **Response Generation**: Creating contextual answers
- **Quality Assessment**: Evaluating response quality and relevance

## 🎯 Bounded Contexts

### 1. RAG Processing Context
**Responsibility**: Core retrieval and generation logic

**Key Entities**:
- `ProcessedQuery`: Rich query representation
- `DocumentChunk`: Knowledge fragments
- `RAGResponse`: Complete response aggregate

**Key Value Objects**:
- `RetrievalResult`: Retrieval outcome with scoring
- `GenerationResult`: Generation outcome with metadata
- `RAGContext`: Complete generation context

### 2. Document Management Context
**Responsibility**: Document lifecycle and processing

**Key Entities**:
- `Document`: Source document with metadata
- `DocumentChunk`: Processed document fragments

**Key Operations**:
- Document ingestion and chunking
- Embedding generation and storage
- Document versioning and updates

### 3. Query Analytics Context
**Responsibility**: Query patterns and performance analysis

**Key Entities**:
- `QuerySession`: User interaction session
- `QueryMetrics`: Performance measurements

**Key Operations**:
- Usage pattern analysis
- Performance optimization
- User behavior insights

## 🏗️ Domain Model Structure

### Entities (Objects with Identity)

#### ProcessedQuery
```python
@dataclass
class ProcessedQuery:
    """Rich query entity with business metadata."""
    original_text: str
    processed_text: str
    query_type: QueryType
    intent: Optional[str] = None
    entities: List[str] = None
    keywords: List[str] = None
    metadata: Dict[str, Any] = None
    timestamp: datetime = None
```

**Business Rules**:
- Must have original text
- Query type must be classified
- Entities and keywords are extracted during processing
- Timestamp tracks when query was processed

#### DocumentChunk
```python
@dataclass
class DocumentChunk:
    """Document fragment entity with embeddings."""
    id: str
    content: str
    metadata: Dict[str, Any]
    embedding: Optional[List[float]] = None
    chunk_index: int = 0
    parent_document_id: Optional[str] = None
```

**Business Rules**:
- Must have unique identifier
- Content cannot be empty
- Chunk index indicates position in parent document
- Embedding is generated after content processing

### Value Objects (Immutable Objects)

#### RetrievalResult
```python
@dataclass
class RetrievalResult:
    """Document retrieval outcome with scoring."""
    chunk: DocumentChunk
    relevance_score: float
    retrieval_method: str
    rank: int
```

**Business Rules**:
- Relevance score must be between 0.0 and 1.0
- Rank indicates position in retrieval results
- Retrieval method tracks which strategy was used

#### GenerationResult
```python
@dataclass
class GenerationResult:
    """Text generation outcome with metadata."""
    generated_text: str
    confidence_score: Optional[float] = None
    tokens_used: Optional[int] = None
    model_used: Optional[str] = None
    generation_time: Optional[float] = None
    metadata: Dict[str, Any] = None
```

**Business Rules**:
- Generated text cannot be empty
- Confidence score represents system certainty
- Token usage tracks resource consumption
- Generation time measures performance

### Aggregates (Consistency Boundaries)

#### RAGResponse
```python
@dataclass
class RAGResponse:
    """Complete RAG response aggregate root."""
    query: ProcessedQuery
    answer: str
    sources: List[RetrievalResult]
    generation_result: GenerationResult
    processing_metadata: Dict[str, Any]
    timestamp: datetime = None
```

**Business Rules**:
- Must have a processed query
- Answer must be generated from provided sources
- Sources must be ranked by relevance
- Processing metadata tracks system performance

## 🔄 Domain Services

### Query Analysis Service
**Purpose**: Analyze and classify user queries

**Operations**:
- Extract entities and keywords
- Classify query type
- Determine user intent
- Enrich query metadata

### Relevance Calculation Service
**Purpose**: Calculate document-query relevance

**Operations**:
- Compute similarity scores
- Apply business rules for relevance
- Rank retrieval results
- Filter low-quality matches

### Response Validation Service
**Purpose**: Validate generated responses

**Operations**:
- Check response quality
- Verify source citations
- Assess confidence levels
- Apply business validation rules

## 📊 Domain Events (Future)

### Query Events
- `QueryReceived`: New query submitted
- `QueryProcessed`: Query analysis completed
- `QueryFailed`: Query processing failed

### Retrieval Events
- `DocumentsRetrieved`: Relevant documents found
- `RetrievalFailed`: No relevant documents found
- `RetrievalOptimized`: Retrieval strategy improved

### Generation Events
- `ResponseGenerated`: Response successfully created
- `GenerationFailed`: Response generation failed
- `QualityAssessed`: Response quality evaluated

## 🎯 Business Rules & Invariants

### Query Processing Rules
1. All queries must be classified by type
2. Query processing must extract entities when possible
3. Original query text must be preserved
4. Processing metadata must be tracked

### Retrieval Rules
1. Minimum relevance threshold must be met
2. Maximum number of sources is limited
3. Sources must be ranked by relevance
4. Duplicate sources must be filtered

### Generation Rules
1. Responses must cite their sources
2. Confidence scores must be calculated
3. Token usage must be tracked
4. Generation time must be measured

### Quality Rules
1. Empty responses are not allowed
2. Responses must be relevant to the query
3. Sources must support the generated answer
4. Confidence must meet minimum threshold

## 🔧 Repository Interfaces

### Document Repository
```python
class DocumentRepository(ABC):
    async def save_document(self, document: Document) -> str
    async def save_chunk(self, chunk: DocumentChunk) -> str
    async def find_chunks_by_query(self, query: ProcessedQuery) -> List[DocumentChunk]
    async def find_chunk_by_id(self, chunk_id: str) -> Optional[DocumentChunk]
```

### Query Repository
```python
class QueryRepository(ABC):
    async def save_query(self, query: ProcessedQuery) -> str
    async def save_response(self, response: RAGResponse) -> str
    async def find_similar_queries(self, query: ProcessedQuery) -> List[ProcessedQuery]
    async def get_query_analytics(self, time_range: TimeRange) -> QueryAnalytics
```

## 🚀 Integration with Database Schema

The domain model maps to the following database structure:

### Core Tables
- `documents`: Source documents
- `document_chunks`: Processed document fragments
- `queries`: User queries with metadata
- `rag_responses`: Generated responses
- `retrieval_results`: Query-document matches

### Analytics Tables
- `query_metrics`: Performance measurements
- `usage_patterns`: User behavior analysis
- `quality_scores`: Response quality tracking

This domain model provides a solid foundation for building a scalable, maintainable RAG application that can evolve with business needs while maintaining data integrity and performance.
